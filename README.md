# The evolutionary dynamics of viral mimic-host protein interactions

This gitHub includes a collection of scripts and command-lines for running and reproducing the analysis workflow.

## Description

This repository contains code for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization. It includes:

- **Command-lines for programs used in this study including flags and parameters used:
GUIDANCE, 3SEQ, PAML, Selecton, BLAST, PhyML, Alphafold, CSU, Alphafold Multimer, AIUpred, ScanNet
.

- **Deatiled scripts for running complete analyses:
1) Structural homology analysis between human and viral proteins, matching mimicking-mimicked proteins
2) Positive selection analysis- At the gene level, categorizing the studied proteins to mimicry-related groups and testing for positive selection enrichment or depletion. At the residue level, categorizing residues by spatial classification (surface, interface, or core) amd testing for positive selection rnrichment or depletion.
3) Evolutionary rates analysis- Testing for higher\lower dN/dS in mimicry-related protein groups.
