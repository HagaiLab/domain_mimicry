PhyML:
# To obtain phylogenetic trees
phyML -i MSA -m GTR -a

AlphaFold:
# To predict viral protein structure (monomer level)
# We used the following GitHub link in order to download and install AlphaFold2: https://github.com/kalininalab/alphafold_non_docker/tree/main
# We then ran it with default parameters on the datasets from 2020-05-14

CSU:
# To infer structural data regarding protein structure (identifying surface and core residues and inter-residue contacts)
resc [PDB input file] [Residue number] [Chain]

AlphaFold-Multimer:
# To predict the 3D structure of protein complexes.
# We used the following GitHub link in order to download and install 
https://github.com/kalininalab/alphafold_non_docker/tree/main
# We then ran it with default parameters on the datasets from 2020-05-14

AIUpred:
# To identify intrinsically unstructured (disordered) regions within protein sequences
# We used the following GitHub link in order to download and install 
https://github.com/doszilab/AIUPred
# We then ran it with default parameters

ScanNet:
# To identify protein binding sites (interface regions) directly from 3D structures
# We used the following GitHub link in order to download and install 
https://github.com/jertubiana/ScanNet
